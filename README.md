Main repository for the Serenity shaderpack for Minecraft: Java Edition, by jcm2606.

# SERENITY
Serenity is a shaderpack for Minecraft: Java Edition, that aims to produce a balance between realism and surrealism.

Serenity is developed against Optifine's shaders implementation, and as such makes frequent use of new features that Optifine provides such as the '#include' directive, new uniforms, new macros, and more.

Fair warning, this shader is constantly evolving and progressing. I frequently jump into a "rewrite mode", and end up rewriting the whole shader. Because of this, often there will be some bugs in the shader, as well as incomplete features. I advise that you either contact me via the shaderLABs Discord server, or create an issue on the Github repository, to notify me of any bugs you find.

# INSTALLATION
To install the latest version, download the .zip archive of the repo. Open the .zip up in any archive viewer, such as WinRAR, and inside should be a folder called 'SerenityShaders-master'. Simply drop that folder in your 'shaderpacks' folder, and select it in-game.

# CREDIT
Most of the code, and the entire structure of the shader, is written by me, with inspiration taken from Ebin.
Volumetric light is written by me, with inspiration taken from Zombye and BruceKnowsHow for the marcher.
Volumetric clouds are heavily inspired by BruceKnowsHow and DatWeirdPerson.
Depth of field belongs to DatWeirdPerson.
The atmosphere belongs to Jodie.
PCSS & the percentage-closer filter are based off of Continuum 1.2's PCSS, with several rewrites being done.

# SHADERLABS
This shader, and its predecessor, Clarity, were both part of the shaderLABs network of shaders. shaderLABs is home to almost all of the Minecraft shader developers, and invites anyone to hop on and discuss really anything with us, with open arms.
