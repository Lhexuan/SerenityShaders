Main repository for the Serenity shaderpack for Minecraft: Java Edition, by jcm2606.

# SERENITY
Serenity is a shaderpack for Minecraft: Java Edition, that aims to produce a balance between realism and surrealism.

Serenity is developed against Optifine's shaders implementation, and as such makes frequent use of new features that Optifine provides such as the '#include' directive, new uniforms, new macros, and more.

# INSTALLATION
To install the latest version, download the .zip archive of the repo. Open the .zip up in any archive viewer, such as WinRAR, and inside should be a folder called "SerenityShaders-master". Inside that folder should be another folder called "Serenity", drag this folder out into your "shaderpacks" folder in order to install Serenity.

# FEATURES
* Custom lighting.
* Dynamic shadowing from the sun/moon.
* Percentage-closer soft shadowing & a percentage-closer filter.
* Physically-based diffuse shading.
* A physically-based atmospheric scattering model for the sky & sun/moon.
* Screen-space reflections.
* Physically-based specular highlight (GGX).
* Refraction.
* Dual-deferred rendering of solid & transparent blocks.
* Shadow-space / projected caustics.
* Volumetric fog & lighting.
* Height fog.
* Water fog.
* Cycle fog (day-to-day fog variation).
* Morning fog.
* Volumetric mist.
* Coloured volumetric lighting & volumetric caustics.
* Bloom.
* Depth-of-Field (coming soon).
* Volumetric clouds (coming soon).

# CREDIT
Most of the code, and the entire structure of the shader, is written by me, with inspiration taken from Ebin.
Volumetric light was originally robobo1221's, however Serenity uses a heavily modified version which incorporates volumetric fog with the volumetric lighting.
The atmosphere, raytracer and AO are Jodie's, used with permission.
The PCSS algorithm is loosely based on Continuum's PCSS algorithm.

Really, thanks has to be given to the entire shaderLABs community, and my own lack of satisfaction towards my shaders, for continuing to push me to strive for better and better.

# SHADERLABS
This shader, and its predecessor, Clarity, were both part of the shaderLABs network of shaders. shaderLABs is home to almost all of the Minecraft shader developers, and invites anyone to hop on and discuss really anything with us, with open arms.
