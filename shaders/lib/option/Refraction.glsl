#define REFRACTION
#define REFRACTION_REALISTIC // Switches to a more realistic approximate of refraction, where the refraction is dependent on the viewing angle to the surface. This causes refraction to sample over the screen near the edges, so you will see near the edges of the screen and over blocks, refraction stops working.
